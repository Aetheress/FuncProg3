# FuncProg3
Functional programming assignment for Kotlin wannabe sets.

Methods Set.exists, Set.map and Set.contents seem a tad too ambitious for someone of my understanding of the subject and required mindset. I don't know if a half-baked assignment is acceptable for evaluation. If not, I expect to get feedback about the assignment not being deserving of a pass and then will try to figure out the remaining three methods somehow.
